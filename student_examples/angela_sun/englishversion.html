Have you not seen 
</p>
<p>
that the waters of the Yellow River come from upon Heaven,
</p>
<p>surging into the ocean, never to return again;
	</p>
<p>Have you not seen</p> 
<p>in great halls' bright mirrors, they grieve over white hair,</p>
<p>at dawn like black threads, by evening becoming snow.</p>
<p>In human life, accomplishment must bring total joy,</p>
<p>do not allow an empty goblet to face the moon.</p>
<p>Heaven made me - my abilities must have a purpose;</p>
<p>I spend a thousand gold pieces completely, but they'll come back again.
</p>
